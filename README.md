<h1>How is Azure structured?</h1>

Azure divides its resources into Tenants, Subscriptions, Resource Groups, Azure Storage Accounts, 

- The Tenant is representative of your organization 
- A subscription in Azure is a way to separate costs. Think of it as the different departments in your organization which all have their own budgets. The accounting department may have it's own subscription under the Tenant and the Sales department may have another separate subscription. 
- Resource Groups are essentially folders that hold the resources that you create in Azure. 
- Storage Accounts are in their most basic form places to storage your files, but with many additional capabilities, like Google Drive on steroids.
